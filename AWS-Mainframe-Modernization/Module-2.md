# Module 2: Getting Started with AWS Mainframe Modernization Service

## Introduction to AWS Mainframe Modernization
AWS Mainframe Modernization helps migrate and modernize mainframe applications to AWS managed runtime environments.

- The service offers tools and resources to help with planning and performing migration and modernization.
- Analyze mainframe programs and create, update, or modify them using programming languages such as COBOL or PL/I.
- Test application functionality and deploy in a managed runtime.
- It is also possible to create an automated pipeline for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) of an application.

### Supported Major Migration Patterns
AWS Mainframe Modernization offers support for two (2) major migration patterns.

#### 1. Automated Refactor
- Using `AWS Blu Age toolchain`, the automated refactor pattern helps accelerate modernization by turning the whole 
legacy application stack (including its data layer) into a modernized, Java-based application while maintaining 
functional equivalence. 
- A multi-tier application with an Angular-based front end, a Java backend with API support, and a data layer that can 
access modern data sources are created as part of this automatic refactor process. 
- The refactor process offers comparable capability to the legacy stack to boost project automation and help realize 
significant benefits.

#### 2. Replatform
- The `Micro Focus Enterprise toolchain powered replatform pattern` is concentrated on maintaining the 
applications' language, code, and artifacts to lessen the impact on application assets and teams.
- Customer can keep up their application skills and enterprise with this pattern. Although the application 
modifications are minimal, this pattern also facilitates the ability to modernize processes and infrastructure. 
- The processes are modified to adhere to best practices for application development and IT operations. The 
infrastructure is upgraded to a modern, cloud-based managed service.
