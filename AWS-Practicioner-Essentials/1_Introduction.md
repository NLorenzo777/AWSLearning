# AWS Practitioner Essentials [↑](../README.md#1-aws-cloud-practitioner-notes)

## Terminologies:
`Cloud Computing`: On-demand delivery of IT resources and applications through the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

`Memory`: A temporary storage are for processing.

`Hardware Accelerators`: A component that can expedite data processing.

`Input/Output Operations Per Second (OIPS)`: A metric that indicates how many I/O operations a
device can perform per second.

### `Deployment Models for Cloud Computing` [↑](#aws-practitioner-essentials-)
When selecting a cloud strategy, a company must consider factors such as required cloud application components, 
preferred resource management tools, and any legacy IT infrastructure requirements.

#### 1. Cloud-Based Deployment
- Run all parts of the application in the cloud.
- Migrate existing applications to the cloud.
- Design and build new applications in the cloud.

#### 2. On-Premises Deployment (private cloud deployment)
- Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.
- Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.
- Resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.

#### 3. Hybrid Deployment
- Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure.
- Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.
- For instance where legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, or government regulations
that require business to keep certain records on premises.


### `Benefits of Cloud Computing` [↑](#aws-practitioner-essentials-)

#### Trade upfront expense for variable expense
`Upfront expense` refers to data centers, physical servers, and other resources that you would need to invest
before using them. `Variable expense` means you only pay for computing resources you consume instead of investing
heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you're going to use them.

#### Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
Cloud computing provides the ability to focus less on data centers that requires more expenses and time managing
infrastructure and servers. Which gives more focus on applications and customers.

#### Stop guessing capacity
Pay only for the compute time that is used. You can also scale in or scale out in response to demand.

#### Benefit from massive economies of scale
Achieve a lower variable cost than getting your own by using cloud computing.
Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers can aggregate in the cloud, providers, 
such as AWS, can achieve higher economies of scale. The economy of scale translates into 
lower pay-as-you-go prices. 

#### Increase speed and agility
Cloud computing flexibility makes it easier to develop and deploy applications.
When computing in data centers, it may take weeks to obtain new resources that is needed. By comparison,
cloud computing enables to access new resources within minutes.

#### Go Global in minutes
Enables to deploy applications to customers around the world quickly, while providing low latency.
